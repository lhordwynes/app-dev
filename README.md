# Arcane
## My favorite series

Arcane dives deep into the lore of some of the league of legends champions.
In this universe, The story branches to different plots and arcs that ultimately
will cross paths with each other. It is set in the twin cities of Piltover and Zaun.
Piltover is like a high-class and prosperous city while the city underneath them is Zaun
which is dark and gritty. 

**Champions that are in the show**

* Vi
* Jinx
* Ekko
* Caitlyn
* Jayce
* Viktor
* Heimerdinger

It became my favorite series because I love the universe and lore of league of legends and I 
think Arcane represents the lore with grace and compelling story. The animation and artstyle
of this show is godlike and is one of the greatest feats of animation industry in my opinion.
